# WDI-9 Project 4: V.i.A

[See the app on Heroku.](https://via-vendor-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Developer

* [Peter Colella](https://github.com/petercolella)

## Concept and Approach

V.i.A is an app that provides user access to key information about a company or organization's approved vendors and purveyors. The app is especially applicable to the restaurant industry in which a wide array of vendors are dealt with on a daily basis. Additionally, the specific information for each vendor changes often and sometimes is not readily communicated from upper management to those who actually use the information.

With this app, users not only have access to vendor information. They can also call, email, link to the vendor's website, and get driving directions if it's necesssary to go to the vendor's location. In short, V.i.A keeps the user's resources organized and accessible.
